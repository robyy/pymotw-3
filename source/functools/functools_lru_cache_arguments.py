# An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a __hash__()
# method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an __eq__() method). Hashable objects which compare equal
# must have the same hash value.
#
# Hashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set member, because these data structures use the hash
# value internally.
#
# Most of Pythonâ€™s immutable built-in objects are hashable; mutable containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are
# not; immutable containers (such as tuples and frozensets) are only hashable if their elements are hashable. Objects
# which are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default. They all compare unequal (except with
# themselves), and their hash value is derived from their id().
