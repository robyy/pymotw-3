# Arguments:
# start, [step]

# Results:
# start, start+step, start+2*step, â€¦

# Example:
# count(10) --> 10 11 12 13 14 ...

# tee() has semantics similar to the Unix tee utility, which repeats the values it reads from its input
# and writes them to a named file and standard output. The iterators returned by tee() can be used to
# feed the same set of data into multiple algorithms to be processed in parallel.
